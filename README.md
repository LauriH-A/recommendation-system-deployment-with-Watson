# recommendation-system-deployment-with-Watson
start-up of the model trained in the Natural-Language-Processing repository using the Watson API

watson APIs require python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6

As of July 30 does not support python 3.7

I created an environment in Anaconda with python 3.5

## for the execution of the notebook it is required to install:

pip install watson-machine-learning-client==1.0.365

pip install watson-developer-cloud

pip install urllib3==1.25

pip install joblib
